# Avatars

Initially the avatar system is going to be pretty minimal.

I'll probably start with the latest UMA, which is dynamic (and this is good, because our code is mostly dynamic).   I envision some sort of provisioning system where you can build your avatars, wardrobe/armor/weapon sets.   

This will also support Aspects (which are different Avatars owned by the same real user).   

Now, to learn UMA, which doesn't seem simple.   Have to figure out the API which would be available to the Avatar's Emissary.

In the other code branch--currently named Proto-Browser (which I'm trying to figure out how to check in, since it's Unity, and I guess I'm not supposed to check in other peoples packages from the unity store---though that should be safe if its from github and has a compatible license), 
I'm trying pushing for enough infrastructure to do a Hello World - Avatar Materializes into world and has a handfull of cubes as Entities which the Avatar can interact with.
